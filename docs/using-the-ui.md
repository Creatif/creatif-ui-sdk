# Using the UI

UI is made to be intuitive but there are some features that are not clear right away. This section will
explain those features. 

# Filtering

Filtering is pretty straightforward. Just press the _Filters_ button and a side screen will appear that lets
you filter by different fields.

# Editing a structure entry

A structure entry can be edited in two ways. The first one is when you are in the listing screen.

You can also go to the individual entry view and edit the item there. Every entry in the list has a set of icons
on the right side of each item. You can edit, change the locale, change groups, view the item and delete the item there.
