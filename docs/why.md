# Why another headless CMS?

In my career, I worked with many CMSs, from Strapi to CraftCMS and none of them made it
easy for me and for my clients. I could understand the learning curve for developers to learn
how a new tool works but I could not understand that for clients. Clients should just be able
to install something and intuitively "know" how something, particular for their industry, works.
It should have a "look and feel" of a custom application specifically created for them. 
Too many CMS systems force us developers to tell *no* to our clients when they ask for a new feature
because this feature is not possible in the CMS that you are using. This can create tension between
you and your client because they need a feature that you cannot deliver. Sure, you can contact support
of the CMS that you are possibly paying thousands of dollars a month, asking for a new feature but
you are at their mercy. 

Before starting to work on Creatif, I did an investigation into headless CMS ecosystem and
there are a lot of them and almost every one of them has some kind of learning curve for clients
and non-technical people. There are also companies that, despite so many tools out there, still
decide to create their own CMS.

For example, a real estate agency wants a data entry application and an API that will
be consumed by their website and their clients looking to rent or buy a property. When using
this data entry application, they should have at least a Properties form where they can input
a new property. When they open the screen, they should see inputs to type address of the property,
what type of property is it and some basic information about the property. It should be intuitive.

There are shining examples, such as PocketBase but you have to know Go to use it beyond the basics
but, all things considered, if you don't like Creatif, I think PocketBase is the way to go.

For myself, I wanted something powerful. Something that will make you think that the search
is over and that you don't have to use another CMS ever again. A CMS that will never make you tell
your clients that something is just not possible. One CMS to rule them all. 
**A CMS so powerful that you can create other CMSs with it**. I'm still not there but 
I hope this a is good enough of a start to get there.

P.S.

Yes, I know saying "One CMS to rule them all" is a little over the top and currently, Creatif is not there yet
but the possibility exists. Done right, this project will, at least, make your life a lot easier.
